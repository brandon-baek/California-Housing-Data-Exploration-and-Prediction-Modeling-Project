# California Housing Data Exploration and Prediction Modeling Project

**The full project can be viewed in the "California_Housing_Data_Analysis_and_Prediction_Project.ipynb" file**

This project was made fully in Google Colab.

This project has discovered correlated variables within the California Housing Dataset. Total rooms, total bedrooms, and households were found to be correlated with the population.

Using these correlations, multiple Linear Regression models were created and updated in order to find the best results. Multiple Linear Regression models were explored, in order to utilize all 3 independent variables (Total rooms, total bedrooms, households) to find the 1 dependent variable (population).

The final model, a Multiple Linear Regression model, achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 273.0197130319185.
